# Project Reflection – OpenGL 3D Scene  

## How do I approach designing software?  
I begin by defining requirements, structuring the architecture, and optimizing for performance. For this project, I designed a **3D scene featuring a padlock and a tennis ball** placed on a table. My focus was on balancing realism with computational efficiency while ensuring smooth user interaction.  

## What new design skills has my work on this project helped me to craft?  
I improved in **3D modeling, texture mapping, and lighting techniques**. I learned to apply a **golden metallic texture to the padlock** and a **fuzzy green texture to the tennis ball**, making them visually accurate while keeping polygon count low. Additionally, I structured my code modularly for better organization and reusability.

## What design process did I follow for my project work?  
I followed an **iterative approach**:  
1. **Planning:** Defined scene composition and object placement.  
2. **Modeling:** Created the padlock using a box for the body and a torus for the shackle, and modeled the tennis ball as a sphere.  
3. **Texturing & Lighting:** Applied realistic textures and multiple light sources, including a **point light inside the padlock** for reflections.  
4. **User Interaction:** Implemented a **camera system for scene exploration** using keyboard and mouse controls.  
5. **Testing & Refinement:** Adjusted object positioning, textures, and lighting for a polished final product.  

## How could tactics from my design approach be applied in future work?  
The **modular coding structure** I used can be applied to future **game development, simulations, and real-time rendering projects**. My experience with **dynamic lighting and camera controls** will also be useful for creating immersive 3D environments.  

## How do I approach developing programs?  
I break tasks into smaller components, use **modular classes for object transformations and rendering**, and optimize performance by managing polygon count and efficient resource allocation. The **SceneManager class** ensures structured object creation, while the **ViewManager class** handles camera navigation.  

## What new development strategies did I use while working on my 3D scene?  
I implemented a **structured scene management system**, multiple **light sources** for depth and contrast, and **interactive camera controls**. The **perspective and orthographic views** allow users to inspect the padlock and tennis ball from different angles.  

## How did iteration factor into my development?  
I refined **object positioning, lighting balance, and material textures** through multiple iterations. Adjustments to **padlock reflections** and **tennis ball surface details** helped achieve greater realism.  

## How has my approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, leading to the project’s completion?  
I progressed from **basic object rendering** to **applying advanced lighting techniques and optimizing camera navigation**. My code became more **modular and scalable**, making future modifications easier.  

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?  
This project reinforced my interest in **computer graphics, real-time rendering, and interactive simulations**. The ability to create **realistic 3D environments** is a valuable skill in fields such as **game development and VR/AR applications**.  

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future educational pathway?  
I gained hands-on experience with **OpenGL, shaders, transformations, and rendering pipelines**, which will support my studies in **advanced computer graphics and visualization techniques**.  

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give me new knowledge and skills that can be applied in my future professional pathway?  
These skills are valuable in careers related to **game development, VR/AR, engineering simulations, and scientific visualization**. My ability to optimize **3D models, lighting, and user interaction** will help me build interactive applications across various industries.
